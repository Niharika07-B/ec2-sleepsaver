## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (Takes 30 seconds)

Click this link to go directly to Pages settings:
👉 **https://github.com/Niharika07-B/ec2-sleepsaver/settings/pages**

Then:
1. Under **"Build and deployment"**
2. Click the **"Source"** dropdown
3. Select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. That's it! No need to click Save, it auto-saves.

## Step 2: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

Monitor the deployment here:
👉 **https://github.com/Niharika07-B/ec2-sleepsaver/actions**

You'll see a workflow called "Deploy to GitHub Pages" running. Wait for the green checkmark ✅.

## Step 3: Access Your Live Site

Once deployed, your site will be live at:
👉 **https://niharika07-b.github.io/ec2-sleepsaver/**

## Troubleshooting

### If you don't see the Actions tab:
- Go to: https://github.com/Niharika07-B/ec2-sleepsaver/settings/actions
- Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"

### If deployment fails:
- Check the Actions tab for error messages
- The workflow file is at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### If you see a blank page:
- Wait a few more minutes
- Clear your browser cache
- Check that the workflow completed successfully
